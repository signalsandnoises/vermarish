👋 Hi, I'm Rishabh!  
👾 I specialize in machine learning and scientific computing.  
🎓 I recently graduated from UC Irvine with a Master of Data Science in December 2024.  
💼 I have 1.5 years of experience in software development and data analysis at Intel and SAP.  
📊 My domain interests include rooting out bias in ML pipelines, mining time series/graphical data, and designing new ways to visualize and interact with data.  
🛠️ Here are two of my latest end-to-end data science projects: [Big Brother Barometer](https://github.com/vermarish/docs-BBBarometer), [LeagHue](https://github.com/vermarish/LeagHue).
