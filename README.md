👋 Hi, I'm Rishabh!  
📊 I am a data and software enthusiast, looking to launch a career in Data Science.  
💼 I am currently interning with [xFusion](https://www.xfusiontech.com/) building the [xAqua Unified Data Platform](https://xaqua.io/) since March 2023.  
🤝 I am currently seeking Data Analyst or Software Engineering roles.  
🎓 I graduated last year from the University of Washington, and studied a mix of Computer Science, Statistics, and Math.  
🛠️ In my free time, I enjoy building applications with machine learning: [Big Brother Barometer](https://github.com/vermarish/docs-BBBarometer), [LeagHue](https://github.com/vermarish/LeagHue).  
🎵 I play guitar, bass, and drums, and am a big audio nerd.  
📕 I love fantasy, sci-fi, and (cosmic) horror stories.
