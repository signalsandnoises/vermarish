👋 Hi, I'm Rishabh!  
👾 I specialize in data science and software engineering.  
🎓 I'm currently studying for a Master of Data Science degree at UC Irvine.  
💼 I'm seeking an ML internship for Summer 2024.  
📊 My domain interests include rooting out bias in ML pipelines, mining time series/graphical data, and designing novel data interaction techniques.  
🛠️ I especially enjoy deploying applications with machine learning models integrated, e.g. [Big Brother Barometer](https://github.com/vermarish/docs-BBBarometer), [LeagHue](https://github.com/vermarish/LeagHue).  
🎵 I play guitar, bass, and drums, and I love the technical side of audio production.  
📕 I enjoy reading fantasy, sci-fi, and horror stories.
